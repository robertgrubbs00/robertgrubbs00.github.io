## About Me

I am currently a sophomore at Catawba College. I am majoring in accounting and minoring in marketing. I was born in Winston- Salem, North Carolina, but i now live in Thomasville, North Carolina. I am a 2018 graduate from Ledford High School. In my free time I enjoy fishing, riding ATV's, watching sports and playing video games.

### Sports

I am an avid sports fan. My favorite team to watch is the Atlanta Braves. I also enjoy going to Charlotte Hornets games every now and then. When I was younger, I used to watch lots of NASCAR. Now that my favorite driver, Matt Kenseth, has retired I watch to race to enjoy it instead of cheering on my dirver.
